*Efficient and simple air treatment option for voron trident*

# Background
There are some decent existing options for moving air through activated carbon pellets for voron printers (eg. the nevermore filter). There have also been efforts to improve this concept using the ventilation opening on the back plate of the trident. These, however, require that new holes to be added to back panel.

The objectives of this mod are:
 - to draw air from the zone where pollutant concentrations will be highest (near the roof of the printer)
 - deposit the treated air at a distant location from the offtake to prevent recirculation
 - make use of the wasted space at the read of the print plate and require no changes to the panels
 - efficiently use a single unmodified 5015 fan, minimal fasteners, and be printable on the trident
 - allow for easy replacement of the treatment media.
 
 # Design
 
 The upper portion attaches to the frame and holds the 5015 fan. The fan can be connected to the mainboard down one of the existing wire bundles along the frame. The middle section screws onto the upper section and holds the treatment media. The collar on teh middle section is print-in-place and should allow for a good deal with the upper section while allowing for appropriate direction of the exhaust. The lower section includes the printed mesh. For a finer mesh a circular portion of fly-screen can be cut and placed between the middle and lower parts.
