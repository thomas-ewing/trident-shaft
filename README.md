*Efficient and simple air treatment option for voron trident*

# Background
There are some decent existing options for moving air through activated carbon pellets for voron printers (eg. the nevermore filter). There have also been efforts to improve this concept using the ventilation opening on the back plate of the trident. These, however, require that new holes to be added to back panel.

The objectives of this mod are:
 - to draw air from the zone where pollutant concentrations will be highest (near the roof of the printer)
 - deposit the treated air at a distant location from the offtake to prevent recirculation
 - make use of the wasted space at the read of the print plate and require no changes to the panels
 - efficiently use a single unmodified 5015 fan, minimal fasteners, and be printable on the trident
 - allow for easy replacement of the treatment media.
